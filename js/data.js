     the case-study details your resume doesn't cover: insights, iterations,
     screenshots). Replace the whole string, including "TODO:".
   • Images: drop files into  assets/img/  and put the path in "src",
     e.g.  src: "assets/img/usda-hero.png". An empty src shows a placeholder.

        reflection: "No single method gave the full picture. The interviews, survey, evaluations, and usability tests each caught different problems, and requiring a finding to appear in at least three methods kept us honest about what mattered. I learned how much a complex federal tool depends on expert knowledge users never say out loud. As the person who built our presentations and ran our team meetings, I also learned that a clear story is part of the research: the findings only helped once stakeholders could follow them. If I did it again, I would recruit first-time importers earlier, and next I would run the card-sorting study we recommended to redesign how help is organized."

Second, the interviews changed the question. We began with high-school graduates skipping college and learned that most alternative-pathway learners are already working and learning for life, so the design had to serve them. Third, synthesis is the hard part. Sorting hundreds of notes into themes was the most demanding stage, and it produced our strongest findings. If I did it again, I would bring education policymakers into the interviews, since we have no insight into how credentials are governed or recognized, and I would test the soft-skill tool first, because that is where Instructure’s strategy and our research met."
